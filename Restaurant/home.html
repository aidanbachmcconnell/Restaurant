				Hi, Welcome to Breakfast at Aidan's! We are one of the top rated breakfast restaurants in the Twin Cities. All of our signature creations are made from scratch with only the finest ingredients. Our meat is never frozen, our waffles are crispy and light, and our bluberry pancakes are the best in Minnesota! We are family owned, and have excellent staff that will work hard to make sure you have a great breakfast experience.
